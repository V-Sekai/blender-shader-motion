# blender_shader_motion_devon

@Aury @ₗᵧᵤₘₐ          𝓛𝔂𝓾𝓶𝓪 Here's a blend with the modifier, my awful scripts (i cleaned them up mildly, but they're still pretty bad), and short writeup on how you might get a different avatar in if you want to go for a ride using my bad code.

The avatar is just VRoid cc0 base model, patched ShaderMotion code and the original video is obviously originally from lox. Consider everything else to be MIT licensed from me (I don't mind what you use it for if you choose to)

I haven't fully tested if merge norm works now that I think about it, so it might break if the avatars move too far from the origin (over 2m in any axis) but I think I did it right, I just have no footage that would actually test that atm since all of the reference footage always stays in the same place
